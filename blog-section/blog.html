            <strong>What is the difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage?</strong>
          <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

          <p>What is global scope function scope and block scope?
            Image result for What is the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope?
            Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function. Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop..</p>

            <strong>How does javascript event loop work</strong>
          <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop..</p>

            <strong>How do I get undefined in JavaScript?</strong>
          <p> You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object.A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned . If you don't mention the return value,You also get a undefined .</p>
